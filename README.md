# Payday-2-weapon-rebalances
This is just a relatively minor rebalance of some weapons for Payday 2. We might expand our scope eventually and rebalance more
weapons and other bits of the game. Most of the changes we made are with another mod, Crackdown in mind.

WEAPON BUFFS
  
  Sniper Rifles:
  
    Rattlesnake Sniper Rifle:
      Damage increased from 246 to 258

    Repeater 1874 Sniper Rifle:
      Damage increased from 246 to 258
     
      The goal with these 2 buffs is to make the Repeater and Rattlesnake rifles able to kill Tasers and Tan units 
      in one headshot, rather than be left at 30 health.
 
  Light Machine Guns:
  
    KSP 58:
        Reload times decreased from 6.5 seconds to 5.62 seconds
        Stability increased from 28 to 36
      
      The goal here was just to make the KSP 58 a lot less clunky and annoying to use without making it too strong.
  
    
WEAPON REWORKS      

    Assault Rifles:
      
      Little Friend 7.62 Rifle:
        Damage decreased from 160 to 58
        Mag capacity increased from 20 to 30
        Total ammo increased from 40 to 120
        Ammo pickup rate increased
        Default fire mode changed from single fire to automatic
        Under barrel grenade launcher is now in the assault rifle catagory
        Under barrel grenade launcher total ammo increased from 3 to 4
      
      Our main focus with this rework was to make the Little Friend actually usable, and a lot more versatile. It's inline
      with the lower damage assault rifles rather than DMR style rifles now, and we hope these changes makes the rifle more viable.
        
      Vulcan Minigun:
        Damage increased from 25 to 80
        Mag capacity increased from 750 to 984
        Stability decreased from 24 to 0
        Maximum kick value increased
        Accuracy increased from 32 to 56
        Ammo pickup rate decreased signifigantly
        Can now shoot through enemies and shields
     
     The idea here was the make the minigun into more of a utility weapon rather than the underwhelming LMG it currently is.
     With these changes, the weapon is an absolutely devestating force in use, however it does require specialized skills if you want to
     sustain the carnage it can unleash.
